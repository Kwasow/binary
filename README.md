# Binary

A website where I put all my teaching material. It helps making them easily
accessible for my students as well as anyone else who want's to learn Computer
Science.

The materials are mostly created for the purpose of preparing Polish high school
students for their maturity exams. Additional materials are also added for those
who want to learn something more.

### Running locally

Make sure you have installed `nodejs` (version 20.x is recommended) and that the
`yarn` package manager is available in your system. When these are installed
just run the command in the root of the project:

```bash
yarn start
```

### Contributing
